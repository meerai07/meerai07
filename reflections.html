    <h1 id="electron-microscope-lab-uc-berkeley-eml">Electron Microscope Lab, UC Berkeley (EML)</h1>
<p>We all know that electron microscopes are cool, and imagine my excitement when I got an opportunity to experience that first hand at the EML. It all started when I needed to image my curcumin samples (see my Research page) in 8th grade and I contacted the EML whose director kindly agreed to image my samples. After that successful project, I was lucky to get an opportunity to intern at EML over two summers. I got great mentorship at EML, where I learned how to prepare samples for imaging, and operate electron microscopes.  A cool project was to prepare and image <em>Pyrgulopsis</em>, a small snail. It required delicate skill to remove the tissues from the hard shell. I developed a novel protocol to preserve the snail’s tissues and organs so they could be imaged under a Scanning Electron Microscope. Another interesting project was the development of a tutorial and guide for image processing of high resolution cryo-tomography datasets for which I worked alongside a post-doc. I am eager to go back to the lab again to work on more exciting projects and learn more!</p>

<h1 id="clinical-experience">Clinical Experience</h1>
<p>I got opportunities to shadow physicians and surgeons over three summers of my high school. I observed surgeries in gynecology, oncology, the gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, and urology. I learned first hand how dedicated physicians are to helping their patients, saving their lives, and how they prioritiz their patients’ health and life. As I accompanied them from the beginning to the end of each day, I saw first hand how hard and long they work, how meticulously they follow protocols, and how much support is required from all the other attending staff.</p>

<h1 id="program-in-algorithmic-and-combinatorial-thinking-pact">Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT)</h1>
<p>I was accepted into the PACT 2022 summer program through a competitive application process. We met as a group of 170 curious students from all over the world to learn combinatorics, probability, theorem proving techniques, etc. The <a href="https://algorithmicthinking.org/instructors">instructor</a> made the class very engaging and entertaining. It required doing a gazillion homework problems each day but I learned a great deal.</p>

<h1 id="aspiring-scholars-directed-research-program-asdrp">Aspiring Scholars Directed Research Program (ASDRP)</h1>
<p>After I worked on my personal science fair project on curcumin, I learned about ASDRP. ASDRP was interesting to me because they were also working on improving bioavailability of naturally occuring molecules to treat cancer. I worked in two research groups to find ways to create novel synthetic analogs of naturally occurring molecules such as <a href="https://www.asdrp.org/items-1-1">EGCG (Epigallocatechin)</a> and Andrographolide, to improve their bioavailability and treat colon cancer. I learned a ton of wet lab techniques such as column chromatography, using NMR machines, sonicators, cellular assays, etc., and a great deal of organic chemistry which later helped me with AP Bio and AP Chem. I also presented at ASDRP organized symposia.</p>
