    <p>In middle school I watched this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do?subtitle=en">TED talk</a> which led me to a <a href="https://a.co/d/iRtXXeC">book</a> called How to develop a brilliant memory week by week by Dominic O’Brien. It was fun to see how I could easily remember long lists of unrelated things with the techniques whereas before, I would struggle.
<br /> <br />
Memory techniques use the brain’s natural ability to remember visual imagery and locations rather than symbols. For example, in one technique, you mentally put things you want to remember at specific locations in your home as you do an imaginary walk. And when you need to remember the list, simply do the walk again in your mind, and you will effortlessly recall your list. I used some of the techniques at school, and was thrilled by the results. 
<br /> <br />
I shared some of the memory techniques I had learned with others through a Memory Club at school. I developed a memory course and led the club members through the different aspects of memory training such as the journey technique, pictorial number technique etc. The club members found this to be very helpful. My eventual goal is to compete in memory competitions but we’re still working on it!<br />  <br />
I also adapted my course for senior citizens struggling with dementia and Alzheimers, and this time it was to remember past events rather than long lists. I offered it at a senior center and the results were amazing. A particular resident was able to recount many details about her life including her relationships with her siblings. This was one of the most meaningful experiences I have ever had.</p>
